WordPress plugin for downloading automatically first remote image from a post and setting it as a featured image (when the post is saved as a draft).

== Description ==

WordPress plugin for downloading automatically **first remote image from a post** and setting it as a **featured image** (when the post is saved as a draft).

The purpose of this plugin is very simple: when a post is saved (not published), it will fetch the first remote/external image that is referenced. The image that is retrieved is then attached to the post as the featured image. There are no settings to configure.

Please do not use this plugin to violate copyrights.

**Usage**

Avoid losing time in the process of setting featured image for each of your blog posts or page whenever you create new content from your WordPress blog site dashboard. This post retrieves the first remote or local image of your post and uses it as a featured image.

If you maintain multiple blogs, just copy paste the post contents from one blog to the other and this plugin will automatically save the first external image to the second blog. There is no need to re-upload images to multiple sites.

This plugin can also retrieve and save images from sites like Flickr, Facebook, Picasa, or any other image stock site once you have added it in your post editor just saving that single post.

No longer overwriting a post existing featured image function added.
